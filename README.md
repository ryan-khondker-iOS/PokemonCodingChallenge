This is a Pokemon encyclopedia app created in Swift using the MVVM architecture.

After launching the app, the user will see a list of Pokemon provided by PokeAPI. The user can then select any Pokemon in the list to show a details page for the selected Pokemon; this page will display additional information about the Pokemon, including their base experience, their abilities, their forms, and their moves.
